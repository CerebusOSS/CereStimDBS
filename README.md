# CereStimDBS

GUI Application for Blackrock CereStim96 with controls that are convenient for DBS surgery.

The C++ Qt-based application was abandoned because (at the time) the CereStim SDK was broken in Debug mode.
Currently the correct application is the one created in Matlab AppDesigner. Please see the `matlab` directory for that code.

The Python application is in development.
