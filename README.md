# CereStimDBS

GUI Application for Blackrock CereStim96 with controls that are convenient for DBS surgery.

Currently the correct application is the one created in Matlab AppDesigner. Please see the `matlab` directory for that code.

The C++ Qt-based application was started then abandoned because the CereStim SDK does not work in Debug mode!

The Python application is in development. It requires a Python interface to the CereStim API we made called [cerestimwrapper](https://github.com/SachsLab/CereStimWrapper).
Unfortunately this only works some of the time and thus the Python application is still in development.
